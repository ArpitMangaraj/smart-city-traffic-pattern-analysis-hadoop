#Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic data collected from various city junctions using the Hadoop ecosystem components such as HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, and HBase. The goal is to understand traffic patterns, vehicle distribution, and congestion hotspots within a smart city framework.

Objectives
Process large-scale traffic data using MapReduce to calculate total vehicle counts at each junction.

Store summarized traffic information in HBase for fast, scalable access.

Use Hive for ad-hoc queries to analyze traffic trends, peak hours, and vehicle type distribution.

Provide insights for smart city planners to optimize traffic management and reduce congestion.

Technologies Used
Hadoop HDFS: Storage of raw traffic data.

MapReduce: Distributed processing to compute vehicle counts.

HBase: NoSQL database to store and retrieve traffic summaries.

Hive: SQL-like interface to run complex queries on traffic data.

Key Features
Total vehicle counts per junction from raw traffic logs.

Average speed and peak traffic hour analysis.

Vehicle type distribution insights.

Storage of processed results in HBase for real-time access.

Easily extensible framework to integrate more traffic sensors and data sources.educe and Hive
