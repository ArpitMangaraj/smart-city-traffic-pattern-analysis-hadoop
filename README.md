Urban traffic congestion is a growing problem for modern cities, leading to increased travel times, air pollution, and decreased quality of life. This project presents a solution to analyze traffic patterns using big data tools, specifically Hadoop. By processing large-scale traffic data from urban areas, we aim to identify congestion hotspots, understand peak traffic hours, and derive insights to support city planning and smart transportation systems.
